      Circular Triangle is a cross-industry, interdisciplinary coalition unlocking the potential of a circular economy in the Triangle. We do this by bringing together leaders across industries, government, and community to create a shared vision for circular economy initiatives and advocating for policies and practices to foster a more circular economy.

        <ul>
            <li>The Triangle is well-positioned to be an innovative leader in circular development with the anchor of three world-class universities; close proximity of agriculture and natural resources; thriving business community; strong social sector and civic organizations; and cross-sector leaders interested in sustainability and equitable economic development.</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Durham offers an unparalleled opportunity to realize the potential of the public and private sectors, communities and residents to create a circular city.</li>
            <li>Durham is actively reimagining itself during the recent period of growth. This growth creates great opportunity but also challenges in equitable housing and jobs, construction waste, consumer consumption and waste, and increased traffic and congestion.</li>
            <li>Designing an inclusive and equitable circular city requires building trust and connection in the local community. Public-private partnerships in Durham are ready to be formed and well-positioned to launch pilot programs that engage the community and enable the circular economy to emerge and achieve measurable impact.</li>
