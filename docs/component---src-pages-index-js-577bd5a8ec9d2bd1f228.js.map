This is a linear economy. The recycling economy tries to break those products down and make new products. But this often results in prolonging its inevitable destination in the landfill, because only 9% of recyclable materials are actually recycled, and those materials can only be recycled so many times before they lose their integrity and value.\n                    </p>\n\n                    <p>\n                        The circular economy represents a fundamentally different way of approaching our economy. Instead of assuming waste is inevitable, a circular economy designs out waste and pollution, keeps using materials over and over, and makes nature healthier. The goal is to create a closed loop of resources, eliminating waste, pollution, and emissions.\n                    </p>\n\n                    <p>\n                        A circular economy is one that is not based on resource consumption and single-use, but one that designs waste out â€“ keeping products, components, and materials circulating in the local economy.\n                    </p>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"container flex\">\n            <div class=\"split\">\n                <div class=\"split-content\">\n                    <Title>Why The Triangle?</Title>\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>The Triangle is well-positioned to be an innovative leader in circular development as the anchor of three world-class universities, close proximity to agriculture and natural resources; thriving business community; strong social sector and civic organizations; and engaged cross-sector leaders interested in sustainability and equitable economic development.</li>\n                        <li>The creativity and entrepreneurship of the Triangle's residents are key attributes that facilitate the creation of a localized circular economy, which will propel the Triangle into an equitable and resilient future.</li>\n                    </ul>\n                </div>\n            </div>\n\n            <div class=\"split dark-primary centered hide-small\">\n                <img src=\"/img/nc.png\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" alt=\"North Carolina Map\" />\n            </div>\n        </div>\n\n        <div class=\"container flex\">\n            <div class=\"split hide-small split-durham\">\n                &nbsp;\n            </div>\n\n            <div class=\"split\">\n                <div class=\"split-content\">\n                    <Title>Let's Start in Durham</Title>\n                    <ul>\n                        <li>Durham offers an unparalleled opportunity to realize the potential of the public and private sectors, communities and residents to create a circular city.</li>\n                        <li>Durham is actively reimagining itself during the recent period of growth.
