Beyond the sheer volume of\n      waste generated in this sector, the materials being wasted have environmental \n      impacts such as greenhouse gas emissions or toxification of air and water. However,\n      this waste stream also represents considerable financial value. For example, the \n      consulting firm Metabolic estimates that the market value of the construction and \n      demolition materials going to waste every year in <a href=\"https://www.metabolic.nl/projects/circular-charlotte/\">Charlotte, NC</a> is around $15 million. \n      If the Triangle is aiming to reduce its carbon footprint and achieve zero waste, we \n      need to eliminate this waste stream by bringing in industry best practices for reusing\n      materials and using circular design principles in the building process. Circular \n      Triangle is eliminating waste in the construction and demolition sector by convening \n      stakeholders across the Triangle to identify opportunities to close the loop in this \n      sector and bringing best practices to the Triangle.\n      </p>\n      </Row>\n    </Container>\n    \n    <Container title=\"Community education\" scheme=\"big-bottom\">\n      <Row>\n        Circular Triangle is working to raise community awareness of\n        circular economy, why it is important, and the benefits of\n        circularity for the Triangle.
