            With purpose-driven circular strategies, policies, and programs designed to regenerate urban and natural systems, the Triangle is a replicable model for mid-sized regions around the world. 
            We identify and implement circular solutions regionally that lead to a cleaner environment and inclusive economy. The result is a resilient and equitable community.
