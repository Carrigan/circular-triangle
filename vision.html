        <ul>
          <li>
            The Triangle is well-positioned to be an innovative leader in circular development with the anchor of three
            world-class universities; close proximity of agriculture and natural resources; thriving business community;
            strong social sector and civic organizations; and cross-sector leaders interested in sustainability and
            equitable economic development.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Triangle is also a magnet for innovative thinkers and doers. Little could spark the imagination and
            ingenuity of these entrepreneurs more than the chance to build something with global reach that will help
            people live, work and play in a way that will allow us to prosper in the long term.

        <ul>
          <li>Durham is ready to take advantage of the transition to a more circular economy, as it forms a key part of
            North Carolina's vibrant Triangle region. </li>
          <li>Durham is actively reimagining itself during the recent period of growth by revitalizing its downtown and
            cultivating new assets in the arts as well as in high-tech innovation. This growth creates great opportunity
            but also challenges in equitable housing and jobs, construction waste, consumer consumption and waste, and
            increased traffic and congestion.</li>
          <li>The area supports a thriving life-sciences sector based in the Research Triangle Park and backed by
            leading universities. </li>
          <li>The creativity and entrepreneurship of the city's residents are key attributes that facilitate the
            creation of a localized circular economy that propels Durham into a equitable and resilient future.</li>
